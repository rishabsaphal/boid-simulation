Objective :
 
 Implementing simple flocking behavior as described by the famous “Boids” flocking model. Boids are what Craig Reynolds used to describe these generic simulated flocking creatures in his paper on flocks, herds, and schools. The basic model describes three simple steering behaviors which govern the motion of individual boids based on the positions and velocities of their nearby flockmates, namely separation, alignment, and cohesion. The neighborhood could be considered as a defining region that influences a boid steering.
 
 Implementation Methodology :
 
 Simulation using web graphics library (webGL) and openGL shader language in Javascript. p5.js is mainly used, along with GLSL.Orbital controls have been integrated with the mouse which allows zoom,pan and rotate.
